# Guess My Number

This is the first (main) full code along project in "The Complete JavaScript Course" on Udemy.

This porject has taken the fundamentals taught in the first two sections of the course and brought in DOM.

HTML and CSS were provided by the course creator, and JS was code-along with several parts issued as challenges which was then reviewed (by myself) in conjunction with the solution video.
